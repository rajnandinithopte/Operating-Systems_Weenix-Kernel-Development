# üî∑ Weenix Operating Systems Kernel Development

## üî∂ Overview
This project is a **semester-long implementation of the Weenix operating system**, focusing on **kernel development, process management, virtual memory, and file system handling**. The Weenix kernel was incrementally built across three major assignments, each adding **essential OS functionalities**. The goal was to develop a **Unix-like kernel** from scratch while exploring key **systems programming concepts**.

## üî∑ Project Structure

### üî∂ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Kernel 1: Process Management & Threading
#### **Objectives:**
This phase focused on implementing **basic process control, thread scheduling, and synchronization mechanisms**. The kernel in this phase was responsible for:

- **Implementing cooperative context switching (`context_switch`)**.  
- **Designing a simple Round-Robin Scheduler**.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Threading & Context Switching**: Implemented the **context switch mechanism** allowing user-space threads to execute cooperatively.  
- **Process Control & Signals**: Built **process lifecycle management** with **parent-child relationships** and **inter-process communication**.  
- **Basic Kernel Shell (`kshell`)**: Created a basic **debugging shell** with **interactive commands** to test thread scheduling.  

#### **Tests Performed for Kernel 1:**

‚úî **Process Lifecycle Tests**  
   - Verified correct behavior of **process creation (`fork`), execution (`exec`), and termination (`exit`)**.  
   - Ensured correct **parent-child relationships** were maintained.
     
‚úî **Thread Scheduling Tests**  
   - Checked that the **scheduler correctly switches between threads** using `context_switch`.  
   - Simulated multi-threaded workloads to verify the **round-robin algorithm**.
     
‚úî **Mutex & Synchronization Tests**  
   - Tested **mutex locking & unlocking** to ensure proper synchronization.  
   - Introduced artificial race conditions to verify **mutex effectiveness**.
     
‚úî **Edge Case Testing**  
   - Checked behavior when **a process attempts to fork itself recursively**.  
   - Verified **behavior when all threads terminate, leaving the system idle**.

### üî∂ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Kernel 2: Virtual File System (VFS) & File Handling
#### **Objectives:**
The second kernel phase introduced **file system management**, allowing user-space programs to perform **file I/O operations**. This included:  
- **Virtual File System (VFS) design & abstraction layer**.  
- **Handling file descriptors, inodes, and superblocks**.  
- **Implementing essential file system system calls (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close`, `dup`, `lseek`)**.  
- **Implementing directory structure handling (`mkdir`, `rmdir`, `unlink`)**.  
- **Synchronizing concurrent access using read-write locks**.  

#### **Key Features:**
- **Filesystem Abstraction Layer**: Created a **VFS interface** that allowed multiple file systems (e.g., **RAMFS, S5FS**) to be mounted.  
- **Path Resolution & Name Lookup**: Implemented **hierarchical file paths**, ensuring **correct inode traversal**.  
- **Buffer Caching & Performance Optimization**: Optimized **I/O operations** using **block caching techniques**.  
- **File Locking Mechanisms**: Added **synchronization primitives** for **concurrent access control**.  

#### **Tests Performed for Kernel 2:**

‚úî **Basic File Operations Tests**  
   - Created test programs to verify **`open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`** behavior.  
   - Ensured **correct file descriptor allocation and release**.
     
‚úî **Path Resolution & Directory Tests**  
   - Tested edge cases such as **absolute vs. relative paths** and **non-existent file handling**.  
   - Ensured `mkdir()` and `rmdir()` correctly updated the **inode table and directory structures**.
     
‚úî **Concurrency and Locking Tests**  
   - Simulated multiple threads reading/writing to the same file to verify **lock enforcement**.  
   - Tested `dup()` and `lseek()` calls under **multi-threaded access scenarios**.
     
‚úî **Corruption Handling Tests**  
   - Deliberately corrupted inode metadata and verified **system resilience to file corruption**.  
   - Checked that **orphaned file descriptors were correctly freed on process termination**.

### üî∂ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Kernel 3: Virtual Memory & Paging
#### **Objectives:**
The third and final kernel phase introduced **virtual memory management**, handling **demand paging, Copy-On-Write (COW), and page swapping**. This phase included:  
- **Implementing page allocation and deallocation (`kmalloc`, `kfree`)**.  
- **Creating page tables for process memory isolation**.  
- **Handling page faults and implementing demand paging**.  
- **Developing Copy-On-Write (COW) to optimize `fork()` system calls**.  
- **Designing an efficient page replacement algorithm**.  

#### **Key Features:**
- **Demand Paging & Lazy Allocation**: Pages were **loaded into memory only when accessed**, reducing startup costs.  
- **Copy-On-Write Optimization**: Forked processes **shared memory pages**, reducing **unnecessary duplication**.  
- **Page Fault Handling**: Implemented a **fault handler** to **load missing pages** from swap storage.

   - Tested swapping behavior under **heavy memory usage scenarios**.
